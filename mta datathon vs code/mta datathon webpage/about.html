    <h2>About Our Team 👩🏽‍💻</h2>
    <p>
        Our team, <strong>Mind the Data Gap</strong>, participated in the MHC x MTA Datathon to explore New York City’s Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) violation data. We split the work based on what each of us does best. Some of us focused on cleaning the data, others on analyzing it, creating visualizations, or coming up with solutions. As sophomores at Baruch College, we come from different majors, including Computer Information Systems, Finance, and Accounting. This mix of skills helped us look at the data in different ways and turn raw ACE violation information into clear and useful insights.

    <h2>Our Question</h2>
    <p>
      Out of the available research questions, we focused on:
      <em><strong>“What do ACE violations tell us about repeat offenders, and how do exempt vs. issued vehicles differ?”</strong></em>
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
     We focused on repeat exempt violations because they make up a large portion of the dataset
     and reveal important insights about both driver behavior and enforcement patterns. By examining
     where exempt vehicles (such as ambulances or commerical vehicles) were flagged most often, we aimed to
     understand whether repeated violations stem from drivers’ choices or from factors like camera
     placement and enforcement coverage. Understanding both the drivers and the system gives a clearer 
     picture of why these violations repeat and what it might mean for traffic safety in NYC.

    <h2>The M101 Route? 🚏</h2>
    <p>
      We selected the <strong>M101 Bus Route</strong> as our case study because it is one of Manhattan’s 
      busiest north-south bus routes and is frequently used by CUNY students. Running through major neighborhoods 
      such as Harlem, the Upper East Side, and Midtown, the M101 passes through areas with heavy traffic congestion, 
      diverse road users, and multiple ACE enforcement zones. By focusing on this route, we were able to analyze 
      violations along a corridor that is both highly trafficked and representative of broader patterns in 
      automated camera enforcement, making it an ideal subject for our study.
