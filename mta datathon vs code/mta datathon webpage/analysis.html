    <h2>Analysis Overview:</h2>
    <p>
      In this section, we present our data analysis of ACE violations on the M101 route.
      We created visualizations to identify trends, repeat offenders, and violation hotspots.

    <h2>Graphs & Visualizations:</h2>

    <!-- Example Graph -->
     <div class="graph">
      <h3>Top Status Violations, Type Violations, & Stop Name Violations</h3>
      <img src="assets/violation status.png" alt="Bar graph of top status violations" width="800">
      <p> The first bar graph shows the distribution of ACE violations by status,
          with emergency vehicles making up the largest share of exempt violations,
          followed closely by commercial vehicles. This makes sense given that the M101
          route passes through Manhattan, a densely populated area with several hospitals,
          police precincts, and other critical facilities where emergency services are frequently needed.
          On the other hand, the high number of commercial vehicle exemptions suggests that these drivers
          may feel more freedom to remain in bus lanes without consequence. This not only slows down public
          transit but also reduces the effectiveness of the ACE cameras. Can this be mitigated? We raise the 
          question here of whether stricter rules for commercial vehicles could help address this issue. 
      </p>

      <img src="assets/violation type.png" alt="Bar graph of top type violations" width="800">
      <p>In this bar graph, we see that 53.42% of all violations on the M101 route are caused 
        by vehicles double parking. This is likely due to the route running along narrow one-way streets
        in congested areas, including busy tourist zones such as Lexington Avenue near 59th and 50th Street.
        These conditions often lead drivers to use bus lanes for double parking, which disrupts traffic flow 
        and delays buses. Can this also be mitigated? </p>

     <img src="assets/violation stop name.png" alt="Bar graph of top stop name violations" width="800">
     <p> Our analysis highlighted two major hotspots for exempt violations along the M101 route: <strong>3rd Avenue</strong> 
        and <strong>Amsterdam Avenue</strong>. Around 45% of violations occur on 3rd Avenue, while 40% of stop names 
        are concentrated on Amsterdam Avenue. These areas are home to several hospitals, EMS stations, police precincts, 
        urgent cares, and commercial businesses, which explains the high presence of ambulances, police vehicles, and commercial 
        traffic. Many of these exempt vehicles are repeat offenders, often flagged for ‚Äúmobile double parking‚Äù as they use bus
        lanes during their operations. Because their violations are waived, these drivers face no deterrent and continue the behavior.
        Together, these two hotspots show how the mix of emergency services, commercial activity, and congestion along the M101 route
        contributes to consistently high exempt violation counts. </p>
        </div>

    <h3>Violations by Time of Day</h3>
    <div class="graph">
      <img src="assets/peaktimes.png" alt="Hourly distribution of violations" width="800">
      <p>This graph displays the number of ACE violations (in thousands) for each hour of the day along the M101 bus route. 
        The distribution is fairly symmetrical and unimodal, with a clear peak between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM, and the highest 
        number of violations occurring around 10:00 AM‚Äîup to 7,500 exempt violations during this hour. The symmetry of the graph 
        suggests that violation frequency gradually increases during the morning, peaks around mid-morning, and then declines in the 
        afternoon and evening. This pattern aligns with typical rush-hour traffic, when streets are most congested and the likelihood 
        of traffic infractions rises. Understanding this temporal pattern helps identify critical periods for enforcement and can guide
         strategies to reduce violations during peak hours.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Repeat Offenders Comparison</h3>
    <div class="graph">
      <img src="assets/exempt repeats.png" alt="top repeat offenders with exempt violations" width="800">
      <img src="assets/issued repeats.png" alt="top repeat offenders with issued violations" width="800">
      <p>Both exempt and issued violations are represented using bar graphs. For exempt violations, the top repeat offenders 
        appear in the hundreds to thousands, indicating a much higher frequency of violations. In contrast, the top repeat offenders
         for issued violations are just over 175, with all other values significantly lower. This contrast demonstrates that exempt 
         violations occur far more frequently than issued violations. Analyzing these patterns helps identify which buses or drivers 
         most often commit violations and provides insight into enforcement effectiveness and areas of higher risk.</p>
