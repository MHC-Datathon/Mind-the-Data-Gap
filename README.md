Hello! Our project focuses on ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement) violations along the M101 bus route! 
In this study, we dive deep into the data to explore the top repeat offenders for exempt violations, 
highlight the key hotspots where and when these violations occur most frequently, and compare repeat 
exempt offenders with vehicles that received issued violations. Our goal is to provide a clear, 
data-driven look at patterns of enforcement and identify areas where violations are most common.
