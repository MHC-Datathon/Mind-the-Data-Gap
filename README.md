Hello! Our project focuses on ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement) violations along the M101 bus route. We dive into the data to 
explore the top repeat offenders for exempt violations, highlight the key hotspots where and when these violations occur most 
frequently, and compare repeat exempt offenders with vehicles that received issued violations. Our goal is to provide a clear, 
data-driven look at enforcement patterns and identify the areas where violations are most common.
